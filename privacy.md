## Who am I?
The website is made and hosted by [Floris Jansen](https://fmjansen.com)

## What data I collect and why
I don’t actively collect any data. Data could end up in my possession, though, if you send me an email or message on a social network. In that case, I will receive the data you send me, and this gets stored on the servers of the respective service, so I can actually see and read your message.

## With whom I share your data
The short answer: nobody ✨ The long answer: as mentioned above, the data is probably stored on the servers of the service through which you’re trying to reach me. If you send me an email, this data will end up on the servers of Google, since I use Gmail. Next to this, I will never share your data with any third party, unless we’ve explicitly agreed on this.

## How long I store your data
Well, kind of forever; I probably won’t actively delete your data, unless you ask me to.

## Your rights concerning your data
If you’ve contacted me, you can request an overview of the data I possess of you. You could also ask me to delete any of your data in my possession, except the kind which we are required to store because of administrative, legal or security purposes.

## Contact
You can always send me an email on privacy@fmjansen.nl with any further questions.
