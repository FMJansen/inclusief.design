There is no single statistic to show us the inclusiveness of the Dutch design field. According to the [CBS Barometer Culturele Diversiteit](https://dashboards.cbs.nl/v3/barometerculturelediversiteit/), in IT services the share of people with a non-western migration background is larger than when considering all job types. However, in industrial design, the opposite is true. And just this statistic doesn’t tell us whether there is a pay gap, the workspace is inclusive, if the share is the same across all management levels, etc.

## Marketing
When we look at related fields, like marketing and communication, the [D&I monitor by World Federation of Advertisers](https://www.bva.nl/artikelen/2021/openbaar/di-monitor-nederlandse-resultaten-bekend) (n=537) tells us that...
- people with a non-Dutch background feel less that they are an important part of the organisation, 
- there is a pay gap of 3-9% between men and women,
- cases of undesirable behaviour are often not being reported.

## Cultuurmonitor
More specific research into the Dutch design scene is being done by the Boekmanstichting with [the Cultuurmonitor](https://www.cultuurmonitor.nl/thema/diversiteit-en-inclusie/), but the results aren’t in, yet.
