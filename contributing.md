This is now a list compiled by a white person, trying to highlight the work of people in colour. While learning, I’m probably ignorant when it comes to a lot of topics. So, please correct me when I’m wrong and point me in the right direction: [Insta](https://www.instagram.com/fmjansennl/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fmjansen), [Telegram](https://telegram.me/fmjansen) or [email](mailto:inclusion@fmjansen.nl) (inclusion@fmjansen.nl).

You can also contribute by creating a pull request on [GitHub]({{ site.repository }}).
