- [NL] CBS has [stats](https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/82816NED/table?dl=3AEFE) on people who finished certain levels of education in the fields of ‘Design, art, languages and history’ (also including AV production, archeology and philosophy) as well as ‘Technology, industry and architecture’ compared to their ‘migration background’ (i.e. Dutch, western and non-western).
    - [For the total population in The Netherlands](https://opendata.cbs.nl/#/CBS/nl/dataset/37325/table?dl=3AEFD), about 75% has a Dutch migration background, 10% has a western migration background and 14% a non-western.
    - For the first (design) category, this fluctuates between 69–85%, 8–21%, 7–12%, respectively for those three categories. For all levels combined, that’s 73%, 17%, 10%, respectively.
    - For the second (technology) category, it fluctuates between 72–85%, 7–17%, 7–11%, respectively. For all levels combined, that’s 82%, 10%, 8%, respectively.
    - For those 2 (of 10 in total) fields, it seems people with a western migration background are sometimes, if not often, over represented, while people with a non-western migration background are always underrepresented.
    - Stats for the (industrial/digital) design field specifically seem to be lacking.
