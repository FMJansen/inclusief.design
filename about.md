## Why

The Dutch design field isn’t an accurate representation of our society, but it should be. To make sure everyone has a chance to design the world around us. It can help to look at diversity, anti-racism and inclusion in the field of design. On a personal, organisational and societal level, we can learn a lot as white designers. To make us more aware, reading and listening to the people of colour we do have is important, but it can be hard to find relevant resources.

## What

This is a non-exhaustive list of resources and things to learn or act upon, based on what designers of color from around the world have been sharing. It’s supposed to be intersectional, too.

## Contributing

This is (and probably will always be) a work in progress.
