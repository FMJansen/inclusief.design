### Why

There is an alarming lack of (visible) black designers and other people of colour in the Dutch industrial/digital design community*. In light of the current upheaval of the Black Lives Matter movement, it can help to look at diversity, anti-racism and inclusion in the field of design. On a personal (listening, being aware of privileges and speaking up), organisational (creating a more inclusive work place or educational institution) and societal level (inclusive design in strategy and execution, celebrating designers of colour, designing for anti-racism, making sure our (environmental) activism is intersectional) we can learn a lot as white designers. To make us more aware, reading and listening to the people of colour we do have is important, but it can be hard to find relevant resources.

(*) It should be mentioned that there is definitely diversity to some degree, for example thanks to students who do/have done their master’s in The Netherlands or moved here after their education. However, Dutch people of colour definitely seem to be underrepresented in the (academic) design field.

### What

So this is a messy, work-in-progress, non-exhaustive list of resources and some general findings for which resources are not yet discovered. There are no call-to-actions yet, because of the mess and WIP, but hopefully they’ll come.
