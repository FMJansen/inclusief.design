## Why

The Dutch design field isn’t an accurate representation of our society, but it should be. To make sure everyone has a chance to design _and_ access the world around us. It can help to look at diversity, anti-racism and inclusion in the field of design. On a personal, organisational and societal level, we can learn a lot as designers (especially if we’re not from marginalized communities ourselves). To make us more aware, reading and listening to the people in marginalized communities in and around design is important, but it can be hard to find relevant resources.

## What

This is a non-exhaustive list of resources and things to learn or act upon, based on what designers marginalized communities from around the world have been sharing. It’s supposed to be intersectional, too.

It would be great to extend this project by also making it insightful how we’re doing as a community/field, to highlight the people who are underrepresented in our field, and more.

## Thanks

This website/project was set up by [Floris](https://fmjansen.com), but the ideas represented here are obviously not my own, but those of all the people of colour, people with a non-binary gender identity, people with disabilities, and those in any other marginalized communities who have been writing about these topics for decades. There are also some people who’ve contributed to this project:
- [Tycho](https://twitter.com/tychografie) who suggested some of the resources and examples
- [Dezge](https://twitter.com/Deszie_) who suggested Diversity Talks
- [Khalid](https://www.instagram.com/khachel/) who has been thinking along and giving (mental) support
- Jana who suggested A Social Designer’s Field Guide to Power Literacy
