## Why do we need an inclusive design scene?

The Dutch design field isn’t an [accurate representation of our society](/statistics), but it should be. To make sure everyone has a chance to design _and_ access the world around us.
Also, there are benefits to making sure your organisation and products are inclusive:
- **Easier recruitment:** Diversity makes recruitment easier, because it’s valued by people who are looking for a job ([Kim Abreu](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240550)) and you’re looking at a larger group of candidates ([Maurice Cherry](https://youtu.be/eBuFCkmyYuA?t=1241)).
- **Better business**: A diverse team improves creativity and diligence ([Katherine W. Phillips](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/)) and it’s linked to higher financial returns ([McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters)).
- **Better products:** More inclusive design solutions work for a broader range of people, which might also mean more users and higher profits ([Maurice Cherry](https://youtu.be/eBuFCkmyYuA?t=1207)). And solutions for the specific needs of a small group of people might be improvements for many ([Microsoft Design](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/), [Disability Science Review](https://medium.com/@mosaicofminds/the-curb-cut-effect-how-making-public-spaces-accessible-to-people-with-disabilities-helps-everyone-d69f24c58785)); think of curb cuts and closed captions.

## What can we do?

Learn! So, this is a collection of learnings from marginalized communities and others, both in and outside of The Netherlands and the field of design. You can use it as inspiration, a checklist, a reading guide, or however you want.
