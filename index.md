## Why?

The Dutch design field isn’t an accurate representation of our society*, but it should be. To make sure everyone has a chance to design _and_ access the world around us.
Also, there are benefits to making sure your company and products are inclusive:
- Diversity makes recruitment easier, because it’s valued by people who are looking for a job. – [Kim Abreu at Glassdoor](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/240550)
- It also makes recruitment easier because you’re looking at a larger group of candidates. – [Maurice Cherry](https://youtu.be/eBuFCkmyYuA?t=1241)
- A diverse team improves creativity and diligence. – [Katherine W. Phillips at Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/)
- It’s also linked to higher financial returns. – [McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters)
- More inclusive design solutions work for a broader range of people (which might also mean more users and higher profits). – [Maurice Cherry](https://youtu.be/eBuFCkmyYuA?t=1207)
- Solutions for the specific needs of a small group of people might be improvements for many; think of curb cuts and closed captions. – Microsoft Design’s [_Inclusive Design_](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/), [Disability Science Review](https://medium.com/@mosaicofminds/the-curb-cut-effect-how-making-public-spaces-accessible-to-people-with-disabilities-helps-everyone-d69f24c58785)

## What can we do?

I want to help Dutch designers find out what they can do. So, this is a collection of learnings from marginalized communities both in and outside of The Netherlands and the field of design. You can use it as inspiration, a checklist, a reading guide, or however you want. And hopefully, more inclusive designers lead to more diverse and inclusive design agencies/departments, which lead to more just and inclusive design processes & products—and maybe even a more just society.

## Next steps

- Collecting more insights, especially about products, process and education
- Getting more people (with actual expertise) to contribute
- Improving the workings/looks/setup of this website
- Collecting statistics on the make-up of the Dutch design community
- Possibly featuring the stories of people who are underrepresented
- Adding a Dutch translation
