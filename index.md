## Next steps

- Collecting more insights, especially about products, process and education
- Getting more people (with actual expertise) to contribute
- Improving the workings/looks/setup of this website
- Collecting statistics on the make-up of the Dutch design community
- Possibly featuring the stories of people who are underrepresented
