## Intro
When trying to make your design process, products and people more inclusive, there are many topics to consider. Diversity in your team can help make more accessible products, for example, which can counter systemic racism, ableism, sexism, ageism, etc. This page tries to cover as many topics as possible to learn and think about, plus preferrably to act and improve on as a designer/team.

## Design
Designers love debating about what design is, but for this website it might be defined as creating products, services, systems and spaces with a certain intent. It’s especially approached from the academic and industrial design point of view, with a human centred approach.

## Racism, equity, intersection&shy;ality, etc.
The Conscious Kid has a great page focussed on some [key terms relating to racial literacy](https://www.theconsciouskid.org/racial-literacy-key-terms). They’ve also listed a *lot* of steps on [how to be a co-conspirator](https://www.theconsciouskid.org/how-to-be-a-coconspirator), which might be good to work on personally.

## Inclusivity
The [toolkit for Inclusie](https://inclusie.gebruikercentraal.nl/) describes ‘inclusion’ as:
> “making sure all humans can participate in society, regardless of their diversity in physical, cognitive (including lingual) and psychosocial capabilities, and the circumstances under which they live.” – translated from Dutch from [Wat is ontwerpen voor inclusie?](https://inclusie.gebruikercentraal.nl/over-de-toolkit-inclusie/wat-is-ontwerpen-voor-inclusie/)

[Kat Holmes](https://katholmesdesign.com/) describes it from a different perspective in her book [Mismatch](https://mismatch.design/), where inclusivity concerns recognizing who is left out and what causes those mismatches. This is also reflected in Microsoft Design’s [_Inclusive Design_](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive/) methodology.

## Accessibility
One way to describe or define accessibility is the following:
> “Accessibility can mean a lot of different things for a lot of different people. But specifically for people with disabilities accessibility means, usually, having access to products and services and spaces that normally present barriers in the way that our society designs or constructs or architects these types of spaces.” – [James Rath](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6ys7QbXQo8?t=114)

Additionally, it might concern making those spaces accessible for people with lower budgets or different cultural or lingual backgrounds, and more.

You can also think about accessibility while focussing less on abilities and more on access, as “Access is (or should be) universal, regardless of ability.” – [Dan Eden](https://daneden.me/blog/2020/access-ability)

## Cultural (mis)appro&shy;priation
Cultural misappropriation and similar terms have varying definitions depending on the context and cultures concerned. The most succint definition I found, which seems to fit many situations, was the following:
> “the appropriation of elements of a subordinated culture by a dominant culture without substantive reciprocity, permission, and/or compensation.” – [Richard A. Rogers’ definition of Cultural exploitation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1468-2885.2006.00277.x)

However, to get a better understanding of the concept and its problems, [Nicole Phillips’](https://www.theodysseyonline.com/satire-as-survival), [Nadra Kareem Nittle’s](https://www.thoughtco.com/cultural-appropriation-and-why-iits-wrong-2834561), [Maisha Z. Johnson’s](https://everydayfeminism.com/2015/06/cultural-appropriation-wrong/) and [Eden Caceda’s](https://www.smh.com.au/opinion/our-cultures-are-not-your-costumes-20141114-11myp4.html) articles might help.

## Bias
Bias is defined by [The Conscious Kid](https://www.theconsciouskid.org/) as
> “Refers to the attitudes or stereotypes that affect our understanding, actions, and decisions in an unconscious manner.” – [Racial Literacy: Key Terms](https://www.theconsciouskid.org/racial-literacy-key-terms)

As those biases exist in people, they are likely to transfer to products in general, but especially the datasets and algorithms used in those products.
