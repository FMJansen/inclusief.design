- Remember you’re always excluding people (from usability tests, interviews, co-design workshops, etc.), so you can be conscious about who you are excluding and ask ‘Who are we missing?’. – [Kat Holmes](https://katholmesdesign.com/) in [Mismatch](https://mismatch.design/), [Tatiana Mac](https://areena.yle.fi/1-50271945), [Benjamin Evans](https://twitter.com/benjamineevans)
- Also consider the power relations in the social/service/system design process, by looking at your own privileges and who gets to be present, decide the design goal, decide what is ‘normal’ in the group, and what role different stakeholders have. – [Maya Goodwill](https://www.power-literacy.com/about) in her [A Social Designer’s Field Guide to Power Literacy](https://www.power-literacy.com)
- Be conscious of the language you use in your products, with regards to the
  - language of choice (e.g. when designing something for the geographical area of The Netherlands, Dutch is an obvious choice, but also adding English, Arabic, French, etc. will make it more accessible)
  - difficulty level, for example with the tips from [Direct Duidelijk](https://www.directduidelijk.nl/schrijftips/tips) or [Taalvaardigheid - Inclusie](https://inclusie.gebruikercentraal.nl/vaardigheden/taalvaardigheid/) from [Gebruiker Centraal](https://www.gebruikercentraal.nl/)
  - vocabulary, for example with the [(Incomplete) Stijlgids voor inclusieve (beeld)taal](https://205rpe43adla3g1ggs4flrux-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/WOMEN-Inc-stijlgids-versie-augustus-2020.pdf) from [Women Inc](https://www.womeninc.nl/).
- Make your digital products accessible, test it, and iterate, according to the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/), with help from [DigiToegankelijkheid](https://www.digitoegankelijk.nl/aanpak), [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/making-your-service-accessible-an-introduction), [Designing For Accessibility And Inclusion](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/04/designing-accessibility-inclusion/ "Smashing Magazine article describing several lenses to look at your digital design to improve accessibility"), [Inclusive Design Principles](https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/), [Exclusive Design Principles](https://exclusive-design.vasilis.nl/)
  - Make your design system as accessible as possible, so the teams using the components and patterns can focus on the harder problems. – [Nick Colley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeyMEDPnPcE1)
- Realize that exclusionary atoms in a design system will lead to an exclusionary society through some steps in between, but also the other way around: inclusive atoms lead to a more inclusive society, plus the existing exclusionary aspects of society can trickle into the product if you’re not resisting it relentlessly. – [Tatiana Mac](https://areena.yle.fi/1-50271945)
- When something ends up being exclusionary despite your best efforts, apologize properly, by 1. not centring yourself, 2. apologising for the impact, 3. making a plan to fix, 4. remember it for next time and 5. pay the knowledge forward. – [Tatiana Mac](https://areena.yle.fi/1-50271945)
- Try to collect as little data as possible, for both privacy reasons and to prevent excluding people in the way you collect or act upon this data. – [Tatiana Mac](https://areena.yle.fi/1-50271945)
